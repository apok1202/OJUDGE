# OJUDGE
It is an implementation of online judge .
Made using DJango,html,css,java-script,sqlite3 and ideone's api.

It have divided the structure in three apps :

1)  REGISTER :
    Its been the home page here contestants to register .
    
2)  PSET :
    Its the admin side and here admin can add problems , testcases and set time for the contest .
   
3)  CONTEST :
    The contest app is for when contest is real-time .Login functionality for teams , ranking-tables , problems-page 
    , problem-descriptions are in this app . The results for submissions are checked also here .
    
P.S. : altough I have implemented it but still a lot can be done in it. If anyone intersted to further add anything orm
    have any other idea to be added e.g. FOR SUBMISSIONS sandboxing can be implemented or in current version its not scaled
    up and at a time only contest takes place at a time .
